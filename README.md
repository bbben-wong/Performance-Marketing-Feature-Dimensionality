# Brand vs. Performance: Predicting Customer Conversion
This project studies the razor-thin line between the performance marketing and the brand-building initiatives with the help of data mining, predictive modeling and exploratory analysis.

# Project Objectives
  - Explore the correlation between performance marketing metrics and the conversion engagement.

  - Explore brand storytelling and non-performance indicators to customer loyalty and long-term value.

  - Predict customer conversion (Conversion: ) using machine learning classification models. 1 = converted, 0 = not).

  - Give insights into which features (performance as well as emotional/brand oriented) have an impact on conversions.

# Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- Jupyter Notebook

# Key Takeaways

- Performance marketing has speed and measurability, but it is usually not emotionally engaging.

- Affective tale-telling adds up to customer loyalty and brand recall, which are in most cases overlooked by short term conversion metrics.

- A hybrid method with the use of data to prioritize measurable results and brand resonance is key to the sustainable growth of brands.

# Why This Matters
This analysis in particular applies to:
- Marketers who are looking to get beyond vanity metrics.
- The brand strategists who want to assign a number to brand value that is non physical.
- Data scientists working on the connection of numbers and narratives.
It is essential to know the boundaries of performance data – and where it needs to be filled with the insight of the emotions – for any brand that is looking for a long life, loyalty, and marquee effects.
